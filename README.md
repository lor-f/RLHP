This is a repository for the primitive revolving heat pipe MATLAB scripts. The general simulation of an oscillating heat pipe is restricted to a single loop and incorporates a modified momentum governing equation to consider additional body force on the liquid regions.

Note: main.m is the main program and calls the functions in the Functions folder, but assumes that those are in the same working directory.
Note: The post processing folders only includes an animation for the internal fluid dynamics which runs off data extracted after a simulation is completed.
