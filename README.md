This is a repository for early rotating heat pipe MATLAB scripts. The general simulation of an oscillating heat pipe is restricted to a single loop and incorporates a modified momentum governing equation to consider additional body force on the liquid regions.

Note: main.m is the main program and calls the functions in the Functions folder, but assumes that those are in the same working directory.
